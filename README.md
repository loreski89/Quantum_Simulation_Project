# Final Quantum Simulation Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates advanced quantum mechanics and quantum computing simulations, incorporating:
- GPU-accelerated simulations of the Dirac equation and ϕ⁴ theory using Numba and CUDA.
- Hybrid quantum-classical simulations integrating Qiskit with classical wavefunction evolution.
- Object-oriented structure for flexibility and extensibility.
- Scientific visualizations using Matplotlib with the potential for VR integration.

## Features
- **GPU Acceleration**: Parallelized Dirac equation simulation and Monte Carlo updates using CUDA.
- **Quantum Computing Integration**: Qiskit integration to simulate quantum circuits and hybrid workflows.
- **Scientific Visualizations**: Real-time visualization of quantum wavefunctions.
- **VR Support (Optional)**: Immersive VR exploration using Unity/Unreal Engine.
- **Unit Testing and CI**: Unit tests for core components and automated testing with GitHub Actions.
